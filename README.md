`vc2_conformance_data`: Data files for VC-2 conformance testing
===============================================================

This Python module contains data files and test pictures used by the
[`vc2_conformance`](https://github.com/bbc/vc2-conformance-software)
conformance testing software.


Work in progress...
-------------------

This software is being produced as part of an effort to develop conformance
testing software for implementations of the SMPTE ST 2042-1 (VC-2) standard.

This software is currently a work in progress.  Contact [Jonathan
Heathcote](mailto:jonathan.heathcote@bbc.co.uk) or [John
Fletcher](mailto:john.fletcher@bbc.co.uk) for more information.
